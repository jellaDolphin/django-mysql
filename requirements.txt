# The base set of requirements for django-mysql are actually just Django and
# MySQL, but for the purposes of development and testing there are a number of
# packages to install.

# Laying these out as separate requirements files, allows us to only include
# the relevant sets when running tox, and ensures we are only ever declaring
# our dependencies in one place.
